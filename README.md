# About the Package
To reduce setup time of repeating Unity Projects I did a packages for a custom [manifest.json](https://gist.github.com/rubin54/c5b6124448ed88feecadda3d5d9adbba) and tools I think are useful in most Projects


# How to Setup the Package

<h3>Step 1</h3>

- Copy the Url : https://github.com/rubin54/Unity_Package.git

- Start a new Unity Project and add the copied url into the Unity PackageManager ( this feature is only available for Unity Version 2020.3 (LTS) or later)

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<h3>Step 3</h3>

- If you want to have custom script templates than you just have to copy the folder from Package in your Asset folder and restart Unity

<h3>Step 5</h3>

- If Packages are needed like the new Input System or other special Packages I might include it in the future through - Tools/Setup/Packages/"PackagesName"
